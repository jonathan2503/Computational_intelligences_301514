# s301514_Computational_intelligence
## Disclaimer
I declare ,for exam evaluation purposes, that this is the first time I have used python or such high-level languages in general.
My computer skills are strongest first in the hardware description side and second with low-level iteration, indeed I belong to the embedded systems track.
### The choice of this course 
I also declare that the reason for choosing this course is because the science of computational intelligence will be the new milestone of technologies in a decade.\
Since I wish to do a PHD in the field of artificial inteligence implemented in hardware I think that this course will give me the useful tools to better understand this emerging technology.
